        <p>I'm a <STRONG>Science Teacher</STRONG> by Profession. I'm very hardworking and ambitious person, who strives to learn new things whenever I gets a chance. I always inspired and amazed by the wonders of technology and programming and wanted to learn it. when I got a chance I jumped into it and did a <em><strong>web development</strong></em> bootscamp course, which made me enable to learn some basics of everything related to programming i.e. <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em>, <em>JAVASCRIPT</em>.
        I've made few websites and started building my portfolio. Now I'm working part time as a freelancer along with my teaching. I've already planned to do some in depth courses and would love to try my luck in programming.</p>
